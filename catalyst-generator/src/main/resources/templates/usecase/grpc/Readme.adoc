It is simple example with server, which getting <message> in request and returns *Hello <message>* in reply.

The client (Camel route) 5 times sends request with name _Camel_ and getting reply, logs it.

=== Running guide
Firstly, you need generate needed classes from file *hellocamel.proto* using special Maven plugin:

    mvn clean install

Run server and client separately:

    - run *HelloCamelServer.java* as simple Java application
    - run spring boot application, which will run only client

        mvn spring-boot:run

== gRPC Connector
This use case includes a basic gRPC client part and server part.
It uses Protobuf for service description. Read more: https://github.com/google/protobuf/wiki

It is simple example with server, which getting <message> in request and returns *Hello <message>* in reply.

The client (Camel route) 5 times sends request with name _Camel_ and getting reply, logs it.

=== Running guide
Firstly, you need generate needed classes from file *hellocamel.proto* using special Maven plugin:
----
mvn clean install
----

Then You have two ways:

 * Simply run spring boot app (server will up automatically)


    mvn spring-boot:run


 * Run server and client separately:
    - delete string _HelloCamelServer.main(args)_ in *DemoApplication.java*
    - recompile project
    - run *HelloCamelServer.java* as simple Java application
    - run spring boot application, which will run only client

This section provides a brief overview of the Spring Initializr reference documentation:
think of it as map for the rest of the document. Some sections are targeted to a specific
audience so this reference guide is not meant to be read in a linear fashion.

Spring Initializr provides a simple web UI to configure the project to generate and
endpoints that you can use via plain HTTP: you can see our default instance at
https://start.spring.io.  The service allows you to customize the project to generate: the
build system and its coordinates, the language and version, the packaging and finally the
dependencies to add to the project. The latter is a core concept: based on the chosen
Spring Boot version, a set of dependencies can be chosen, usually Spring Boot starters,
that will have a concrete impact on your application. More details in the
<<user-guide.adoc#user-guide>> section.

You can easily create your own instance of the Initializr, by using the jars as libraries
in your own app. There is minimal code involved and the service has a very rich
configuration structure, allowing you to define not only the values of various project
attributes but also the list of dependencies and the constraints to apply to them. If that
sounds interesting, then <<configuration-guide.adoc#configuration-guide>> has all the
details you need. You might only want to modify an existing instance of the Initializr,
e.g. to add a new dependency type, or update the version of an existing
one. For those and other simple and common use cases check out
<<configuration-guide.adoc#configuration-howto>>.

The Initializr also provides an extensible API to generate quickstart projects, and to
inspect the metadata used to generate projects, for instance to list the available
dependencies and versions. The API can be used standalone or embedded in other tools
(e.g. it is used in Spring Tool Suite, and in the IntelliJ IDEA and Netbeans plugins for
Spring Boot). These features are covered in <<api-guide.adoc#api-guide>>.

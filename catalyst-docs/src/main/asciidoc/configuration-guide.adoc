This section describes how you can create your own instance of the service and tune it for
your needs, and also how you can configure an existing instance. You'll also find some
advanced tips to make sure the available options are consistent with the chosen Spring
Boot generation.
--



[[create-instance]]
== Creating your own instance
Spring Initializr is split across three main modules:

* `catalyst-generator`: standalone project generation library that can be reused in
many environments (including embedded in your own project)
* `catalyst-web`: API endpoints and web interface
* `catalyst-actuator`: optional module to provide statistics and metrics on project
generation

Because it contains several auto-configurations, creating your own instance is quite easy,
actually you could get started using Spring Initializr itself to generate a starting point!

Create a new project with the `web` dependency and add the following dependency:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
	<dependency>
		<groupId>com.intellecteu.catalyst</groupId>
		<artifactId>catalyst-web</artifactId>
		<version>{spring-initializr-version}</version>
	</dependency>
----

Or if you are using Gradle:

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
compile("io.spring.initializr:catalyst-web:{spring-initializr-version}")
----

If you start the application, you'll see the familiar interface but none of the drop down
lists have values (except the one for the Spring Boot version, we will
<<create-instance-boot-versions,come back to that later>>). In the rest of this section,
we will configure those basic settings.

[TIP]
====
Most of the settings are configured via `application.properties` using the `initializr`
namespace. Because the configuration is highly hierarchical, we recommend using the yaml
format that is more readable for such structure. If you agree, go ahead and rename
`application.properties` to `application.yml`.
====



[[create-instance-basic-settings]]
=== Configuring basic settings
Most of the drop-down lists are configured via a simple list-based structure where each
entry has an `id`, a `name` and whether that entry is the default or not. If no `name` is
provided, the `id` is used instead.

Let's configure the languages and the Java versions we want to support:

[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
	initializr:
	  javaVersions:
		- id: 9
		  default: false
		- id: 1.8
		  default: true
	  languages:
		- name: Java
		  id: java
		  default: true
		- name: Kotlin
		  id: kotlin
		  default: false
----

If you click on the "Switch to the full version" link, the two drop down lists now offer
the options and default values defined above.

Spring Initializr supports `java`, `groovy` and `kotlin` and additional languages can be
added in your own customization.

The available packagings are also configurable that way:

[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
	initializr:
	  packagings:
		- name: Jar
		  id: jar
		  default: true
		- name: War
		  id: war
		  default: false
----

These two packaging types are the only one explicitly supported at the moment.



[[create-instance-boot-versions]]
=== Configuring available Spring Boot versions
If you look at http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot[the project home page for Spring
Boot], the latest versions are displayed. And you've probably noticed that they match the
drop down list that you automatically get with a default instance of the Initializr. The
reason for that is that Spring Initializr calls an API on spring.io to retrieve the
latest versions automatically. This makes sure that you always get the latest available
versions.

If you are behind a proxy, or need to customize the `RestTemplate` that is used behind the
scenes, you can define a `RestTemplateCustomizer` bean in your configuration. For more
details, {spring-boot-reference}/#boot-features-restclient-customization[check the
documentation].

If you don't want the version to be upgraded automatically, you need to override the
`InitializrMetadataProvider` bean to provide your own metadata for the service. For
instance, you could swap to an implementation that always returns the contents of static
`application.yml`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	@Bean
	public InitializrMetadataProvider initializrMetadataProvider(
			InitializrProperties properties) {
		InitializrMetadata metadata = InitializrMetadataBuilder
				.fromInitializrProperties(properties).build();
		return new SimpleInitializrMetadataProvider(metadata);
	}
----

The thing to remember is that, by default, you don't have to worry about upgrading your
instance when a new Spring Boot version is released. However, you may need to
<<create-instance-advanced-config-caching,configure caching>> to avoid requesting that
service too often.



[[create-instance-types]]
=== Configuring available project types
The available project types mostly define the structure of the generated project and its
build system. Once a project type is selected, the related action is invoked to generate
the project.

By default, Spring Initializr exposes the following resources (all accessed via HTTP GET):

* `/pom.xml` generate a Maven `pom.xml`
* `/build.gradle` generate a Gradle build
* `/starter.zip` generate a complete project structure archived in a zip
* `/starter.tgz` generate a complete project structure archived in a tgz

Each type also defines one or more *tags* that provides additional metadata entries to
qualify the entry. The following standard tags exist:

* `build`: the name of the build system to use (e.g. `maven`, `gradle`)
* `format`: the format of the project (e.g. `project` for a full project, `build` for just
a build file).

By default, the HTML UI filters all the available types to only display the ones that have
a `format` tag with value `project`.

You can of course implement additional endpoints that generate whatever project structure
you need but, for now, we'll simply configure our instance to generate a Gradle or a Maven
project:

[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
	initializr:
	  types:
		- name: Maven Project
		  id: maven-project
		  description: Generate a Maven based project archive
		  tags:
			build: maven
			format: project
		  default: true
		  action: /starter.zip
		- name: Gradle Project
		  id: gradle-project
		  description: Generate a Gradle based project archive
		  tags:
			build: gradle
			format: project
		  default: false
		  action: /starter.zip
----

NOTE: If you intend to build a custom client against your service, you can add as many
tags as you want, and process them in the client in a way that makes sense for your users.

For instance, the spring boot CLI uses them as a shortcut to the full type id. So rather
than having to create a Gradle project as follows:

[indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
	$ spring init --type=gradle-project my-project.zip
----

You can simply define a more convenient build parameter:

[indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
	$ spring init --build=gradle my-project.zip
----


With that configuration, you should be able to generate your first project,
congratulations! Let's now add dependencies so that you can start searching for them.



[[create-instance-dependencies]]
=== Configuring dependencies
The most basic `dependency` is composed of:

* An `id` used in clients to refer to it
* The full maven coordinates of the dependency (`groupId` and `artifactId`)
* A display `name` (used in the UI and the search results)
* A `description` can (and should) be added to provide more information about the
dependency

Spring Initializr automatically considers that a dependency without maven coordinates
defines an official Spring Boot starter. In such a case, the `id` is used to infer the
`artifactId`.

For instance, the following configures the `spring-boot-starter-web` Starter:

[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
	initializr:
	  dependencies:
		- name: Web
		  content:
			- name: Web
			  id: web
			  description: Full-stack web development with Tomcat and Spring MVC
----

Each dependency is contained in a _group_ that gathers dependencies sharing a common
surface area or any other form of grouping. In the example above, a `Web` group holds our
unique dependency. A group can also provide default values for various settings, see the
<<howto-group-share-settings,dedicated how-to>> for more details.

In our `spring-boot-starter-web` example above, the dependency is _managed_ by Spring
Boot so there is no need to provide a `version` attribute for it. You'll surely need to
define additional dependencies that are not provided by Spring Boot and we strongly
recommend you to use a <<create-instance-boms,Bill Of Materials (or BOM)>>.

If no BOM is available you can specify a version directly:

[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
	initializr:
	  dependencies:
		- name: Tech
		  content:
			- name: Acme
			  id: acme
			  groupId: com.example.acme
			  artifactId: acme
			  version: 1.2.0.RELEASE
			  description: A solid description for this dependency
----

If you add this configuration and search for "acme" (or "solid"), you'll find this extra
entry; generating a maven project with it should add the following to the pom:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim"]
----
	<dependency>
		<groupId>com.example.acme</groupId>
		<artifactId>acme</artifactId>
		<version>1.2.0.RELEASE</version>
	</dependency>
----

The rest of this section will detail the other configuration options.



[[dependencies-version-range]]
==== Availability (version range)
By default, a dependency is available regardless of the Spring Boot version you have
selected. If you need to restrict a dependency to a certain Spring Boot generation you
can add a `versionRange` attribute to its definition. A version range is a range of
versions of Spring Boot which are valid in combination with it. The versions are *not*
applied to the dependency itself, but rather used to filter out the dependency, or modify
it, when different versions of Spring Boot are selected for the generated project.

A typical version is composed of four parts: a major revision, a minor revision, a patch
revision and a qualifier. Qualifiers are ordered as follows:

* `M` for milestones (e.g. `2.0.0.M1` is the first milestone of the upcoming 2.0.0
release): can be seen as "beta" release
* `RC` for release candidates (e.g. `2.0.0.RC2` is the second release candidate of
upcoming 2.0.0 release)
* `RELEASE` for general availability (e.g. `2.0.0.RELEASE` is 2.0.0 proper)
* `BUILD-SNAPSHOT` for development build (`2.1.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT` represents the latest
available development build of the upcoming 2.1.0 release).

TIP: snapshots are in a bit special in that scheme as they always represents the "latest
state" of a release. `M1` represents the most oldest version for a given major, minor and
patch revisions.


A version range has a lower and an upper bound, and if the bound is inclusive it is
denoted as a square bracket (`[` or `]`), otherwise it is exclusive and denoted by a
parenthesis (`(` or `)`). For instance `[1.1.6.RELEASE,1.3.0.M1)` means from all versions
from `1.1.6.RELEASE` up to but not including `1.3.0.M1` (concretely no including the
`1.3.x` line and after).

A version range can be a single value, e.g. `1.2.0.RELEASE`, which is short for "this
version or greater". It is an inclusive lower bound with an implied infinite upper bound.

If you need to specify "the latest release" in a given line, you can use a `x` rather than
an hard-coded version. For instance, `1.4.x.BUILD-SNAPSHOT` is the latest snapshot build
of the 1.4.x line. For instance, if you want to restrict a dependency from `1.1.0.RELEASE`
to the latest stable release of the 1.3.x line, you'd use `[1.1.0.RELEASE,1.3.x.RELEASE]`.

Snapshots are naturally ordered higher than released versions, so if you are looking to
match a dependency to only the latest snapshots of Spring Boot, you could use a version
range of `1.5.x.BUILD-SNAPSHOT` (assuming 1.5 was the latest).

TIP: Remember to quote the values of a version range in YAML configuration files (with
double quotes "").

See below in the section on <<howto-link-boot-version,linking versions>> for more examples
and idioms.



[[dependencies-repository]]
==== Repository
If the dependency is not available on Maven Central (or whatever default repository that
is configured on your end), you can also add a reference to a repository. A repository is
declared at the top level (under `env`) and given an id via the key in the configuration:

[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
initializr:
  env:
    repositories:
      my-api-repo-1:
        name: repo1
        url: http://example.com/repo1
----

Once defined, the repository can then be referred back to in a dependency

[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
initializr:
  dependencies:
    - name: Other
      content:
        - name: Foo
          groupId: org.acme
          artifactId: foo
          version: 1.3.5
          repository: my-api-repo-1
----

It is usually preferable to have a BOM for every dependency, and attach the repository to
the BOM instead.

TIP: The snapshots and milestones repositories on `repo.spring.io` are automatically
available with the `spring-snapshots` and `spring-milestones` identifiers respectively.



[[create-instance-boms]]
=== Configuring Bill of Materials
A Bill of Materials (BOM) is a special `pom.xml`, deployed to a Maven repository, and used
to control dependency management for a set of related artifacts. In the Spring Boot
ecosystem we usually use the suffix `-dependencies` on the artifact id of a BOM. In other
projects we see `-bom`. It is recommended that all dependencies are included in a BOM of
some sort, since they provide nice high level features for users of the dependency. It is
also important that 2 BOMs used in a project do not contain conflicting versions for the
same dependency, so the best practice is to look at the existing BOMs in the Initializr
before you add a new one, and make sure that you aren't adding a conflict.

In the Initializr a BOM is declared at the `env` level, and given an id through the
configuration key. Example:

[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
initializr:
  env:
    boms:
      my-api-bom:
        groupId: org.acme
        artifactId: my-api-dependencies
        version: 1.0.0.RELEASE
        repositories: my-api-repo-1
----

If a BOM requires a special, non-default repository, then it can be referred to here,
instead of having to explicitly list the repository again for each dependency. A
dependency, or a dependency group, can declare that it requires the use of one or more
BOMs by referring to the id:

[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
initializr:
  dependencies:
    - name: Other
      content:
        - name: My API
          id : my-api
          groupId: org.acme
          artifactId: my-api
          bom: my-api-bom
----



[[dependencies-mappings]]
==== Map coordinates according to the Spring Boot version
In addition to a Spring Boot version range for the dependency or a BOM, you can configure
the version relationships at a finer grained level using version mappings. A dependency or
BOM has a list of "mappings", each of which consists of a version range, and a set of one
or more dependency properties to override for those versions of Spring Boot. You can use a
mapping to switch the version of a dependency, or (better) the BOM, or to change its
artifact id (if the project changed its packaging) for instance.

Here's an example of a BOM with mappings:

[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
initializr:
  env:
    boms:
      cloud-bom:
        groupId: com.example.foo
        artifactId: acme-foo-dependencies
        mappings:
          - versionRange: "[1.2.3.RELEASE,1.3.0.RELEASE)"
            version: Arcturus.SR6
          - versionRange: "[1.3.0.RELEASE,1.4.0.RELEASE)"
            version: Botein.SR7
          - versionRange: "[1.4.0.RELEASE,1.5.x.RELEASE)"
            version: Castor.SR6
          - versionRange: "[1.5.0.RELEASE,1.5.x.BUILD-SNAPSHOT)"
            version: Diadem.RC1
            repositories: spring-milestones
          - versionRange: "1.5.x.BUILD-SNAPSHOT"
            version: Diadem.BUILD-SNAPSHOT
            repositories: spring-snapshots,spring-milestones
----

The primary use case here is to map Spring Boot versions to the preferred or supported
versions of the Foo project. You can also see that for the milestone and snapshot BOMs,
additional repositories are declared because those artifacts are not in the default
repository.

TIP: We also use the `x` trick in version ranges to avoid updating the range every time
a new Spring Boot 1.5 bug fix release is available

See below in the section on <<howto-link-boot-version,linking versions>> for more examples.



[[dependencies-alias]]
==== Aliases
A dependency has an id (e.g. "web-services"), but it could be necessary to provide a new
id and still be able to serve request from client using the now deprecated id. To do so,
an alias can be defined for ths dependency;

[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
initializr:
  dependencies:
    - name: Other
      content:
        - name: Web Services
          id: web-services
          aliases:
            - ws
----

The same project can now be generated with `dependencies=ws` or
`dependencies=web-services`.



[[dependencies-facet]]
==== Facets
A "facet" is a label on a dependency which is used to drive a code modification in the
generated project. In the standard Initializr generator, there is only one facet that is
actually used (`web`), but custom installations might choose to use it for their own
purposes. The `web` facet is used to drive the inclusion of `spring-boot-starter-web` if
any other dependency with that facet is included. The value of the "facets" property of a
dependency is a list of strings.



[[create-instance-dependencies-link]]
==== Links
Links can be used to provide descriptive and hyperlink data to guide to user on how to
learn more about a dependency. A dependency has a "links" property which is a list of
`Link`. Each link has a `rel` label to identify it, an `href` and an optional (but
recommended) `description`.

The following `rel` value are currently officially supported:

* `guide`: the link points to a guide describing how to use the related dependency. It
can be a tutorial, a how-to or typically a guide available on https://spring.io/guides
* reference: the link points to a section of a developer guide typically or any page that
documents how to use the dependency

The url can be templated if its actual value can change according to the environment. An
URL parameter is specified with curly braces, something like
`https://example.com/doc/{bootVersion}/section` defines a `bootVersion` parameter.

The following attributes are currently supported:

* `bootVersion`: the Spring Boot version that is currently active

Here is an example that adds two links to the `acme` dependency:

[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
	initializr:
	  dependencies:
		- name: Tech
		  content:
			- name: Acme
			  id: acme
			  groupId: com.example.acme
			  artifactId: acme
			  version: 1.2.0.RELEASE
			  description: A solid description for this dependency
			  links:
			    - rel: guide
				  href: https://com.example/guides/acme/
				  description: Getting started with Acme
			    - rel: reference
				  href: http://docs.example.com/acme/html
----



[[create-instance-dependencies-search]]
==== Improve search results
Each dependency can have a `weight` (a number >=0) and also `keywords` (list of string)
that are used to prioritize them in the search feature in the web UI. If you type one of
the keywords into the "Dependencies" box in the UI, those dependencies will be listed
below, in order of decreasing weight, if they have one (unweighted dependencies come
last).



[[configuration-howto]]
== '`How-to`' guides
This section provides answers to some common '`how do I do that...`' type of questions
that often arise when configuring Spring Initializr.



[[howto-add-a-new-dependency]]
=== Add a new dependency
To add a new dependency, first identify the Maven co-ordinates of the dependency you want
to add (`groupId:artifactId:version`) and then check which versions of Spring Boot it works
with. If there are multiple versions that work with different versions of Spring Boot,
then that's fine too.

* If there is a published BOM that manages the version of you dependency, then add that
  first, in the `env` section (see <<create-instance-boms>>).
* Then configure the dependency, fitting it into an existing group if you can, otherwise
  creating a new group.
* If there is a BOM then omit the version.
* If there is a Spring Boot version range (or min or max) that you need for this
  dependency, add that as a <<howto-link-boot-version,linked version>>.



[[howto-override-a-version]]
=== Override the version of a dependency
Sometimes it happens that the BOM that normally manages your dependency version is in
conflict with the newest version. Or maybe this is the case for only a range of Spring
Boot versions. Or maybe there just is no BOM, or it's not worth creating one for just one
dependency. In these cases you can specify the version manually for a dependency either
at the top level, or in a
<<howto-link-boot-version,version mapping>>. At the top level it looks like this (just
a `version` property in a dependency):

[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
	initializr:
	  dependencies:
		- name: Tech
		  content:
			- name: Acme
			  id: acme
			  groupId: com.example.acme
			  artifactId: acme
			  version: 1.2.0.RELEASE
			  description: A solid description for this dependency
----



[[howto-link-boot-version]]
=== Link a Boot version to a version of your dependency
If your dependency requires a specific version of Spring Boot, ot different versions of
Spring Boot require different versions of your dependency there are a couple of mechanisms
to configure that.

The simplest is to put a `versionRange` in the dependency declaration. This is a range of
versions of Spring Boot, not of your dependency. For example:

[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
initializr:
  dependencies:
    - name: Stuff
      content:
        - name: Foo
          id: foo
          ...
          versionRange: 1.2.0.M1
        - name: Bar
          id: bar
          ...
          versionRange: "[1.5.0.RC1,2.0.0.M1)"
----

In this example `Foo` is available for Spring Boot 1.2.0 (or any milestone of 1.2.0) or
greater, and `Bar` is available for Spring Boot 1.5.0 up to, but not including 2.0.0.

If different versions of your dependency work with different versions of Spring Boot,
that's when you need the `mappings` property. A mapping is a combination of a
`versionRange` and some or all of the other properties of the dependency, overriding
the values defined at the top level. For example:

[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
initializr:
  dependencies:
    - name: Stuff
      content:
        - name: Foo
          id: foo
          groupId: org.acme.foo
          artifactId: foo-spring-boot-starter
          versionRange: 1.3.0.RELEASE
          bom: cloud-task-bom
          mappings:
            - versionRange: "[1.3.0.RELEASE,1.3.x.RELEASE]"
              artifactId: foo-starter
            - versionRange: "1.4.0.RELEASE"
----

In this example, The artifact of `foo` was changed to `foo-spring-boot-starter` as of the
version that is compatible with Spring Boot 1.4. This mapping instruct that if Spring Boot
1.3.x is selected, the artifact Id should be set to `foo-starter`.

A mapping can also be applied to a BOM declaration. For example:

[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
initializr:
  env:
    boms:
      my-api-bom:
        groupId: org.acme
        artifactId: my-api-bom
        additionalBoms: ['my-api-dependencies-bom']
        mappings:
          - versionRange: "[1.0.0.RELEASE,1.1.6.RELEASE)"
            version: 1.0.0.RELEASE
            repositories: my-api-repo-1
          - versionRange: "1.2.1.RELEASE"
            version: 2.0.0.RELEASE
            repositories: my-api-repo-2
----

In this example Spring Boot versions up to 1.1.6 select version 1.0.0 of the BOM, and set
a different repository. Spring Boot versions 1.2.1 and above select 2.0.0 of the BOM and
yet another repository.



[[howto-add-snapshot-repository]]
=== Configure a snapshot repository
A dependency, or a BOM, might require the use of a specific repository, if the default one
(usually Maven Central) does not contain the artifacts. Normally, the best place to
declare that is in the BOM configuration, but if there isn't a BOM then you can put it in
the dependency itself. You can also use a Spring Boot <<You can declare a
repository,version mapping>> to override the default repository for a dependency or BOM.



[[howto-dependency-starter-flag]]
=== Make sure a regular dependency brings the base starter
If a dependency does not stand on its own (and specifically if it does not depend on an
existing Spring Boot starter) you can flag it as a "non starter":

[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
initializr:
  dependencies:
    - name: Stuff
      content:
        - name: Lib
          id: lib
          groupId: com.acme
          artifactId: lib
          starter:false
----

When a project is generated that only has dependencies with this flag set, then the base
Spring Boot starter is added as well.



[[howto-group-share-settings]]
=== Share common dependency settings in a group
A dependency group is a hint for user interface implementations, to group things together
for users when they are selecting dependencies. It is also a convenient way to share
settings between dependencies because every dependency inherits all the settings. The most
common settings in a group are the `groupId`, `versionRange` and `bom`:

[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
initializr:
  dependencies:
    - name: Stuff
      bom: stuff-bom
      versionRange: "[1.3.0.RELEASE,2.0.0.M1)"
      content:
...
----

These dependencies, by default, will be available only for Spring Boot versions 1.3 up to
2.0 (excluded) and will bring in the `stuff-bom` BOM.



[[create-instance-advanced-config]]
== Advanced configuration



[[create-instance-advanced-config-caching]]
=== Caching configuration
If you use the service, you'll notice that the logs have lots of entries with the message
`Fetching boot metadata from https://spring.io/project_metadata/spring-boot`. To avoid
checking for the latest Spring Boot versions too often, you should enable caching on your
service. Spring Initializr has some auto-configuration to apply the proper caches if you
are willing to use a JCache (JSR-107) implementation.

Add the `javax.cache:cache-api` and your favorite JCache implementation and simply enable
caching by adding `@EnableCaching` to your `@SpringBootApplication`. For instance, you
could use `ehcache` by adding the following:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----

Or if you are using Gradle:

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
compile("javax.cache:cache-api")
compile("org.ehcache:ehcache")

You'll notice that the log entry is much more rare. If you do not want to use JSR-107, you
should configure the cache yourselves. Here are the caches used by the application (each
one will require some configuration to get it working):

.Cache configuration
|===
| cache name | Description

|`initializr.metadata`
|Cache the full metadata of the service. When the metadata expires, it is fully resolved
again (including a check on spring.io for the latest Spring Boot versions). Adapt the
expiration settings accordingly.

|`initializr.dependency-metadata`
|Cache dependency-specific metadata.

|`initializr.project-resources`
|Cache resources that are used to generate projects.

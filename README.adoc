== Catalyst

*Catalyst Bootstrap* (hereinafter Catalyst) is **the first open source** integration toolkit connecting traditional infrastructures with modern blockchain-based eco-systems and IoTs.

All implementations you do with Catalyst are lightweight by design, basically, it does not have any of specific abstractions and does not impose you to overengineer your implementations: you just select required connectors set and ask Catalyst to produce integration sample to follow up your task. Each of such samples get equipped with *operational transactionality*, *error handling engine* and *secure by design* features. In addition, cluster implementations of Catalyst provide with natural resilience and reliability of business flows it runs.

Technologically, Catalyst is built on top of two major frameworks:

- Apache Camel - https://camel.apache.org
- Spring Initializr - https://start.spring.io


:boot-doc: http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle

== Supported interfaces

Catalyst can be used as follows:

* With your browser (i.e. link:https://catalyst-bootstrap.herokuapp.com/[])
* In your IDE if you are using STS, IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate or NetBeans (with
https://github.com/AlexFalappa/nb-springboot[this plugin])
* On the command-line with {boot-doc}/#cli-init[the Spring Boot CLI] or simply with
`cURL` or `HTTPie`

[TIP]
====
You can "curl" an instance to get a usage page with examples

== Generating a project
If you click on "Generate Project" on the web ui of our instance, it will download a
project archive with a Maven-based project and the necessary infrastructure to start
a basic Spring Boot app.

[[build]]
== Building from Source

You need Java (1.8 or better), Maven 3.2+ and a bash-like shell.

[[building]]
=== Building

Just invoke the build at the root of the project

[indent=0]
----
    $ ./mvnw clean install
----

If you want to run the smoke tests using Geb, you need to enable the
`smokeTests` profile. Firefox should also be installed on your machine:

[indent=0]
----
    $ ./mvnw verify -PsmokeTests
----

If you want to build both the library and the service, you can enable the `full`
profile:

[indent=0]
----
    $ ./mvnw clean install -Pfull
----


[[run-app]]
=== Running the app locally

Once you have <<building, built the library>>, you can easily start the app as any
other Spring Boot app from the `catalyst-service` directory:

[indent=0]
----
    $ cd catalyst-service
    $ ../mvnw spring-boot:run
----

== Notes
* Since Camel uses the same placeholders as Mustache templates used by initializer,
in code when Camel {{}} properties are used, Mustache delimiters are temporary replaced.

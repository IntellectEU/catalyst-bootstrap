**Catalyst Bootstrap** (hereinafter Catalyst) is **the first open source** integration toolkit connecting traditional infrastructures with modern blockchain-based eco-systems and IoTs.

All implementations you do with Catalyst are lightweight by design, basically, it does not have any of specific abstractions and does not impose you to overengineer your implementations: you just select required connectors set and ask Catalyst to produce integration sample to follow up your task. Each of such samples get equipped with *operational transactionality*, *error handling engine* and *secure by design* features. In addition, cluster implementations of Catalyst provide with natural resilience and reliability of business flows it runs.

Technologically, Catalyst is built on top of two major frameworks:
1. Apache Camel - https://camel.apache.org
2. Spring Initializr - https://start.spring.io
